# Introduction to ADB
Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a versatile command-line tool that allows you to communicate with an Android device from your computer. It provides a bridge for developers to debug their applications, but it's also a powerful tool for Android enthusiasts to perform various tasks on their devices.

adb reboot-bootloader: Reboots the device into bootloader or fastboot mode.  
adb root: Restarts ADB with root permissions, if available.  

### Shell
adb shell: Opens an interactive shell on the device, allowing you to run commands directly.  

### Devices
adb devices: Lists all devices connected to the computer.

### Get Device Android Version

### LogCat
adb logcat: Displays real-time system logs from the device.  
adb logcat -c: Clears the current logs on the device.
